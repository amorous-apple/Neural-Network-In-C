The goal of this project is to learn about how neural networks work by building one from the ground up using C and no external libraries. 

The progam can be compiled by running `make` and the run by typing `./bigbrain`. 

Much of my fundamental understanding of neural networks comes from 3B1B's excellent YouTube series on neural networks:

Inspiration for some of the structuring were taken from the following Github project, as well as testing the function of the network using the project's calculated weights:

The dataset used is a CSV-formatted version of the MNIST dataset from Kaggle:
